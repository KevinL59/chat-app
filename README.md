# JustChat Application

![JustChat logo](/public/img/justchat-logo.png)

*Join, Chat, Quit, Repeat!*

[JustChat](https://just-chat-io.herokuapp.com/) is the simplest chat application ever. Just join a room and chat freely with all room members. As JustChat record nothing from you (neither your username nor your messages), your privacy is completely respected. And it will always be the case. This project is open source. You can fork the project and reuse it for your own needs or propose new features (see next section).

## Existing/coming features

See the [Product Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/wXjoZEEp/justchat-roadmap) for more information about existing and coming features. Feel free to propose new feature ideas as issues with **features** label.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Andrew Mead.

It's also thank to his course that I have today enough Node.js skills to continue working on this application.
